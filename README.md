# aero-structures
Resources for analyzing aircraft structures for aerospace engineers.

# Scope
This resource page covers many topics that are needed to analyze aircraft structures using classical methods developed from aerospace leaders such as Elmer F. Bruhn, Michael Niu, Warren Young (aka Raymond J. Roark), and Sighard F. Hoerner. FEA methods are not covered.

Additionally, this page also covers ways to port these methods into Python 3, allowing engineers become more effective at their job by rolling their own code to effectively interface with other engineers in a professional environment.

Ultimately, these resources should:
* Be a quick reference for non-FEA structural analysis methods used in the aerospace industry
* Help you [save time](https://xkcd.com/1205/) by automating & optimizing routine analysis in Python
* (TBD)

# Rationale
A frequent problem engineers run into (or sometimes bring upon themselves) is the inability to effectively communicate analysis & findings to their colleagues, managers, and clients. This problem is made worse when engineers fail to document their process in a meaningful, accessible way. As programmers quickly learn, the person most confused by reading your code is your future self after failing to include comments and docstrings. This page is a first step in documenting my most frequently used analysis tools, and hopefully serve as a template for you to do the same.

Another, more aerospace-specific problem exists for professional engineers and students. While there are many resources for aerospace engineering, much of it is scattered about disparate places around the net (e.g. [NASA NTRS](https://ntrs.nasa.gov/search.jsp), countless threads on [Eng-Tips](http://www.eng-tips.com/)) and around the world. Aerospace engineering in particular has a lot of "tribal" knowledge that becomes lost when veteran engineers, mechanics, and fabricators retire or pass away without disseminating their decades of experience and knowledge to the next generation. There's simply no replacement for this knowledge, and very little of it makes it into modern aerospace texts, let alone the lecture hall.

For students, this is problematic when trying to attain the requisite knowledge to enter a very limited & competitive job market. Some of these resources will address the *"Why didn't I learn this in engineering school?"* that students may encounter after working professionally for a number of years. Hopefully these resources will accelerate that learning process and save young engineers from committing grave but preventable mistakes.
